# react-native-system-emoji-picker

A React Native component that opens the **native system emoji picker** and returns the selected emoji through a simple event-driven API.

On iOS the picker is backed by a hidden `UITextField` configured to show the emoji keyboard (keyboard type raw value `124`). On Android it presents Jetpack's `EmojiPickerView` in a native dialog. No private APIs or method swizzling are used.

> **Platform support:** iOS and Android.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-native-system-emoji-picker
# or
yarn add react-native-system-emoji-picker
```

### iOS — CocoaPods

```sh
bundle install
cd ios && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
```

If your system `pod` command is missing, always run CocoaPods through Bundler (`bundle exec`) in the project that contains the `Gemfile`.

Add the following to your `Podfile` if it isn't there already:

```ruby
use_frameworks! :linkage => :static   # optional, but required for Swift pods in some setups
```

### Android

No extra setup is required beyond React Native autolinking. The Android library bundles `androidx.emoji2:emoji2-emojipicker` automatically.

## Usage

### With `useEmojiKeyboard` hook (recommended)

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Button, KeyboardAvoidingView, Platform, View } from 'react-native';
import {
  SystemEmojiPicker,
  useEmojiKeyboard,
} from 'react-native-system-emoji-picker';

export default function App() {
  const emojiKeyboard = useEmojiKeyboard();
  const [emoji, setEmoji] = useState('');

  return (
    <KeyboardAvoidingView
      behavior={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'padding' : undefined}>
      <View>
        <Button title="Pick emoji" onPress={emojiKeyboard.open} />
        <Button title="Dismiss" onPress={emojiKeyboard.dismiss} />
      </View>

      <SystemEmojiPicker
        ref={emojiKeyboard.ref}
        onEmojiSelected={(e) => setEmoji(e)}
        onOpen={() => console.log('Emoji keyboard opened')}
        onClose={() => console.log('Emoji keyboard closed')}
        keyboardAppearance="dark"
        autoHideAfterSelection
        dismissOnTapOutside
      />
    </KeyboardAvoidingView>
  );
}
```

### With a ref directly

```tsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { Button, View } from 'react-native';
import {
  SystemEmojiPicker,
  SystemEmojiPickerHandle,
} from 'react-native-system-emoji-picker';

export default function App() {
  const pickerRef = useRef<SystemEmojiPickerHandle>(null);

  return (
    <View>
      <Button
        title="Pick emoji"
        onPress={() => pickerRef.current?.open()}
      />

      <SystemEmojiPicker
        ref={pickerRef}
        onEmojiSelected={(emoji) => {
          console.log('Selected emoji:', emoji);
        }}
        keyboardAppearance="light"
        autoHideAfterSelection
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```

## API

### `useEmojiKeyboard()`

A hook that creates and manages a ref for `<SystemEmojiPicker>` and returns an
`EmojiKeyboardController` with clean `open` / `dismiss` methods.

```tsx
const emojiKeyboard = useEmojiKeyboard();

emojiKeyboard.open();    // opens the emoji keyboard
emojiKeyboard.dismiss(); // closes the emoji keyboard

// Pass the ref to SystemEmojiPicker:
<SystemEmojiPicker ref={emojiKeyboard.ref} />
```

### `<SystemEmojiPicker>`

| Prop                     | Type                      | Default | Description                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `onEmojiSelected`        | `(emoji: string) => void` | —       | Fired each time the user selects an emoji. The `emoji` string may be a multi-codepoint sequence (family emoji, skin-tone variants, etc.). |
| `onOpen`                 | `() => void`              | —       | Fired when the emoji keyboard appears.                                                                                                    |
| `onClose`                | `() => void`              | —       | Fired when the emoji keyboard is dismissed.                                                                                               |
| `keyboardAppearance`     | `'light' \| 'dark'`       | —       | Optional picker color scheme override. On iOS it controls the keyboard appearance. On Android it controls the dialog theme and surface.   |
| `autoHideAfterSelection` | `boolean`                 | `false` | Automatically dismiss the keyboard after an emoji is selected.                                                                            |
| `dismissOnTapOutside`    | `boolean`                 | `false` | Dismiss the keyboard when the user taps outside of it.                                                                                    |
| `style`                  | `StyleProp<ViewStyle>`    | —       | Optional style overrides. The component renders with zero dimensions by default.                                                          |

### `SystemEmojiPickerHandle` (ref)

```ts
interface SystemEmojiPickerHandle {
  /** Opens the emoji keyboard. */
  open: () => void;
  /** Dismisses the emoji keyboard (if visible). */
  dismiss: () => void;
}
```

---

## How it works

### iOS

1. A hidden `UITextField` is added as a subview with a zero frame.
2. Its `keyboardType` is set to `UIKeyboardType(rawValue: 124)` — a publicly accessible enum case that selects the emoji keyboard.
3. Calling `open()` makes the text field the first responder, which causes iOS to present the emoji keyboard.
4. `UITextFieldDelegate.textField(_:shouldChangeCharactersIn:replacementString:)` intercepts each emoji tap and forwards it to JavaScript. The text field is always kept empty (the method returns `false`) so it behaves purely as a picker.
5. `UIResponder.keyboardWillShow/Hide` notifications drive the `onOpen` / `onClose` events.
6. When `dismissOnTapOutside` is `true` and the keyboard is open, a transparent full-screen overlay is shown. Tapping it calls `dismiss()`.

### Android

1. A hidden native anchor view is mounted in the React Native tree.
2. Calling `open()` shows a bottom-anchored native dialog.
3. The dialog hosts Jetpack's `EmojiPickerView` from `androidx.emoji2:emoji2-emojipicker`.
4. When the recent list is empty, the Android wrapper hides the placeholder recent section so the picker opens directly on the standard categories.
5. The dialog surface follows light and dark mode automatically, and `keyboardAppearance` can override it.
6. When the user picks an emoji, the native view emits `onEmojiSelected` and optionally dismisses itself when `autoHideAfterSelection` is enabled.
7. Dialog show and dismiss events drive `onOpen` and `onClose`.

### What is NOT used

- No private APIs
- No private selectors
- No `setForceDisableDictation:`
- No method swizzling
- No runtime tricks

## App Store Compatibility

### Will Apple's binary scanner flag this library?

**No.** Apple's automated App Store binary analysis looks for three categories of private API usage:

1. **Private symbol references** — imports of symbols (functions, classes, methods) from Apple's private frameworks (`PrivateFrameworks`, SPI headers, etc.).
2. **Private selector names as strings** — Objective-C selectors like `_setForceEnableDictation:` that match Apple's internal method names or begin with an underscore.
3. **Dynamic private API lookups** — calls to `dlopen`, `dlsym`, `objc_getClass`, `NSSelectorFromString`, or `performSelector:` with private names.

This library uses **none** of the above.

### Why `UIKeyboardType(rawValue: 124)` is safe

The only part of this library that could raise questions is the use of `UIKeyboardType(rawValue: 124)`.

- **No symbol is emitted in the binary.** The integer literal `124` compiles to a plain load-immediate instruction. There is no string, no symbol reference, and no Mach-O export entry for `124`. Apple's scanner has no mechanism to detect that a specific integer was used as a `UIKeyboardType` raw value.
- **No private method or selector is called.** The value is assigned to `UITextField.keyboardType`, a fully public API property.
- **No runtime tricks are involved.** There is no `objc_msgSend`, `performSelector:`, method swizzling, or ISA manipulation anywhere in the library.

### Summary

| Check                                                 | Result                                    |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Private framework imports                             | ✅ None                                    |
| Private Objective-C selectors                         | ✅ None                                    |
| `dlopen` / `dlsym` / `NSSelectorFromString`           | ✅ None                                    |
| Method swizzling                                      | ✅ None                                    |
| `UIKeyboardType(rawValue: 124)` detectable by scanner | ✅ Not detectable — plain integer constant |

### Runtime risk (separate from App Store validation)

While this library will **not** block App Store validation, `UIKeyboardType` raw value `124` is undocumented by Apple, which means it could theoretically change in a future iOS release. In practice the value has been stable across every iOS version since the emoji keyboard was introduced (iOS 13–18). The implementation falls back to `.default` if the raw value ever becomes invalid, so the app will not crash — the emoji keyboard simply will not appear.

## Example app

See [`example/App.tsx`](./example/App.tsx) for a self-contained demo inside a full React Native template (iOS and Android projects are included under `example/ios` and `example/android`).

To run it:

```sh
cd example
npm install
bundle install
cd ios && bundle exec pod install && cd ..
npm run ios
```

If you see `can't find gem cocoapods ... executable pod`, run `bundle install` in `example` and retry `bundle exec pod install`.
